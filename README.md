## About Cinagree

Cinagree is a fun application that lets a group of people choose the right flick for movie night.

## How it works (WIP)

1. One person needs to create a "room" that all the others can join.
2. Everyone agrees on categories to watch (like drama, thriller or horror)
3. All watchers get a list of movies that they can agree or disagree to.
4. üèÜ The movie that everyone agreed with is the winner
